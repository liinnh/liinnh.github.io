        <h3>FAQ</h3>

        <p>Q: Where did you get your data?</p>

        <p>A: The cocktails and recipes were pulled from <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php">The Cocktail
                DB</a>, an open source database for cocktail recipes.</p>

        <p>Q: How did you decide whether a drink is similar to another drink?</p>

        <p>A: All the unique ingredients that appear in the cocktails were grouped into more general categories. For
            example, the Vodka category includes Vodka, Absolut Vodka, Raspberry Vodka, Vanilla Vodka, and Peach Vodka. Then, the
            data was one-hot encoded to create dummy variables that indicate whether or not each drink contains each of the
            general ingredient groups. Then, the cosine similarity between every possible
            pairing of drinks was computed. If 2 drinks contain similar enough ingredients (similarity greater than a certain threshold
            value), they are linked to one another.</p>

        <p>Q: How come the color or category of some drinks aren't what I would expect?</p>

        <p>A: Drinks were categorized based on their primary ingredient, which is usually the first ingredient in the
            cocktail recipe from the dataset. This isn't always the case, so please reach out if you notice a drink assignment
            that doesn't make sense and I will reassign it.</p>
